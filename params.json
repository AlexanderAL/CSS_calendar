You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)\r\n\r\n# This is an <h1> tag\r\n## This is an <h2> tag\r\n###### This is an <h6> tag\r\n\r\n*This text will be italic*\r\n_This will also be italic_\r\n\r\n**This text will be bold**\r\n__This will also be bold__\r\n\r\n*You **can** combine them*\r\n\r\n###Lists\r\nSometimes you want numbered lists:\r\n\r\n1. One\r\n2. Two\r\n3. Three\r\n\r\nSometimes you want bullet points:\r\n\r\n* Start a line with a star\r\n* Profit!\r\n\r\nAlternatively,\r\n\r\n- Dashes work just as well\r\n- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:\r\n  - Like this\r\n  - And this\r\n\r\n###Blockquotes\r\n\r\nAs Kanye West said:\r\n\r\n> We're living the future so\r\n> the present is our past.\r\n\r\n###Links\r\nhttp://github.com - automatic!\r\n[GitHub](http://github.com)\r\n\r\n###Images\r\nIf you want to embed images, this is how you do it:\r\n\r\n![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)\r\n\r\n![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)\r\nFormat: ![Alt Text](url)\r\n\r\n###Headers & Quotes\r\n# Structured documents\r\n\r\nSometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.\r\n\r\n### This is a third-tier heading\r\n\r\nYou can use  one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:\r\n\r\n> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.\r\n> - Captain Janeway\r\n\r\n###Code\r\nInline code\r\n\r\nI think you should use an\r\n`<addr>` element here instead.\r\n\r\nThere are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:\r\n\r\n    if (isAwesome){\r\n      return true\r\n    }\r\n\r\nGitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (isAwesome){\r\n  return true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nif (isAwesome){\r\n  return true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Task Lists\r\n- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported\r\n- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)\r\n- [x] this is a complete item\r\n- [ ] this is an incomplete item\r\n\r\n###Tables\r\nYou can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:\r\n\r\nFirst Header | Second Header\r\n------------ | -------------\r\nContent from cell 1 | Content from cell 2\r\nContent in the first column | Content in the second column\r\n\r\n###Extras \r\nGitHub supports many extras in Markdown that help you reference and link to people. If you ever want to direct a comment at someone, you can prefix their name with an @ symbol: Hey @kneath — love your sweater!\r\n\r\nBut I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:\r\n\r\n- [x] This is a complete item\r\n- [ ] This is an incomplete item\r\n\r\nAnd, of course emoji! :sparkles: :camel: :boom:\r\n\r\n###SHA references\r\nAny reference to a commit’s SHA-1 hash will be automatically converted into a link to that commit on GitHub.\r\n\r\n16c999e8c71134401a78d4d46435517b2271d6ac\r\nmojombo@16c999e8c71134401a78d4d46435517b2271d6ac\r\nmojombo/github-flavored-markdown@16c999e8c71134401a78d4d46435517b2271d6ac\r\n\r\n###Username @mentions\r\nTyping an @ symbol, followed by a username, will notify that person to come and view the comment. This is called an “@mention”, because you’re mentioning the individual. You can also @mention teams within an organization.\r\n\r\n###Automatic linking for URLs\r\nAny URL (like http://www.github.com/) will be automatically converted into a clickable link.\r\nStrikethrough\r\n\r\nAny word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.\r\n\r\nlink\r\nhttps://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
